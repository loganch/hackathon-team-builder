# Team Wide Web

## Pain Point
Students arrive at a hackathon- without friends, without an idea, without the courage to make a pitch for other participants to join their team.

## Solution
Hackathon participants can be sorted into teams of 3 based on either common interests or different interests.

## How It Works
1. A student logs their interest in the hardware, software or business field via Google Forms.
2. This data is stored in a Google Spreadsheet.
3. Our web-app (hosted on Domains.com) has two buttons: "Common Interests" and "Different Interests." The hackathon coordinator can choose how to create teams.
4. A Google Spreadsheet node module accesses the spreadsheet. An algorithm creates teams according to the button pressed in Step 3.
5. The team assignments are displayed horizontally on the website. 

## Development Challenges
- Working with express.js for the first time: understanding syntax, workflow, directories
- Pulling data from Google Spreadsheets: finding a method (API) to do so efficiently
- Graphic design: setting the colors of the cards

## Team Accomplishments
- Good team communication was established at the start of the project
- Many ideas surfaced during the "brain dump"
- We could acknowledge when a project idea had already been built/executed, and could move on to something new with no hard feelings
- Planned the final project with outlines, diagrams, pseudocode, pictures
- Overcame all the Development Challenges

## Lessons Learned
1. Be careful with merge conflicts.
2. Always look for a node module for your project before you start building.
3. Document **all** your work: brainstorming, planning stages, code.
4. Don't be afraid to share ideas. (Speak up!)
5. Have multiple ideas or methods.

## What's Next for Team Wide Web?
- Refine for use in future hackathons.
- Collect feedback from users to improve our product and better suit their needs.
